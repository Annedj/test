## Goal

The Goal of this tech test is to test your knowledge with Ruby on Rails and implement a short Stimulus controller. This tech test will cover some Rails and ActiveRecord concepts, as well as some Stimulus ones that you will need to use.

## Challenge

- Create a to-do list Rails app and a Task model with a name, a description, a completed field and a deadline date.
- The app will only have one page, with the form to add a new Task on your to-do list, and the list below.
- New tasks should be inserted without reloading the page, and should be sorted from the oldest to the newest deadline.
- Each task should have a checkbox or an icon to indicate whether the task has been completed.
- You can try using Stimulus and create a Stimulus controller to handle this. You can check the lecture `From design to code` from the bootcamp to get started.

## Bonus
- Add a section on your to-do list regrouping the tasks that have been missed (not completed and with a deadline in the past). You can try using a model scope.
- Without implementing them, which tests could you write to make sure your app is robust?

## Submission
- Make sure to edit the Readme file to add your instructions on how to run your app properly, install gems if needed and setup the database to have at least a few tasks from the seeds to display.
- Send back your repo to Anne ðŸ¤—
